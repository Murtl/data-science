## Student Performance Factors
Dataset from Kaggle -> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/student-performance-factors

This dataset provides a comprehensive overview of various factors affecting student performance in exams. It includes information on study habits, attendance, parental involvement, and other aspects influencing academic success.

### Research Questions
Which factors influence student performance the most, and how can we predict a studentâ€™s performance based on these factors?

### Metholodgy

### Step 1: Data Exploration
* Investigate and understand the data and its values
* Visualize the data (scatter plots, histograms, heatmaps).
* Investigate the correlation of the values with the exam_grade.

### Step 2: Data Preprocessing


### Step 3: 


#### Building a Prediction Model:
* Data Preprocessing: Feature scaling, one-hot encoding of categorical variables.
* Model Training: Use Autogluon to find the best model for predictions.

#### Interpret the Results:
* Identify the most important factors influencing performance.
* Derive actionable recommendations (e.g., support programs based on the results or other datasets to enhance the model).
